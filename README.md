Assignments
***************************************************************************************************
Assignment 1  ( Verilog )

Implement an ALU that supports the following 8 operations:
* Adding two 4-bit numbers.
* Subtracting two 4-bit numbers.
* Adding 1 to a 4-bit number.
* Subtracting 1 from a 4-bit number.
* Bitwise ANDing two 4-bit numbers.
* Bitwise ORing two 4-bit numbers.
* Bitwise XORing two 4-bit numbers.
* Arithmetic shifting right of a 4-bit number that will discard the least significant bit.
The output of the ALU must be a 5-bit number, where the additional bit is the most significant one.
Use structured Verilog descriptions for all aspects, except for:
* The test bench and the flip-flops: You can use behavioral Verilog description.

Assignment 2  ( Verilog )

Implement an ALU that supports the following 8 operations:
* Adding two N-bit numbers.
* Subtracting two N-bit numbers.
* Adding 1 to a N-bit number.
* Subtracting 1 from a N-bit number.
* Bitwise ANDing two N-bit numbers.
* Bitwise ORing two N-bit numbers.
* Bitwise XORing two N-bit numbers.
* Arithmetic shifting right of a N-bit number that will discard the least significant bit.
The output of the ALU must be a (N+1)-bit number, where the additional bit is the most significant one.
Use structured Verilog descriptions for all aspects, except for:
* The test bench and the flip-flops: You can use behavioral Verilog description.
******************************************************************************************************
Assignment 3  ( Assembly )

Write an AT&T assembly program that can be compiled in the same way the blackboard samples are compiled.
The program should take the following inputs from the user:
* An integer n.
* n floating point numbers (Use the "double" type. Do not use "float" type.)
The program should output the sum and the average of the n input numbers.
Example:
The user inputs: 3 1.2 2 6.1
The program outputs: sum=9.3 avg=3.1
